ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Mallory Allen. I write a lot of code for various reasons, professional and un.

Some facts:
- I drink a lot of coffee :coffee:
- I have two adorable cats :two: :x: :cat:
- Iâ€™m interested in web development, developer tooling, and virtual reality ðŸ‘€  :robot: :computer:
- In my spare time I've been messing around making social VR experiences using VRChat Udon / UdonSharp ðŸŒ± 
- I've been trying to learn enough rust to function :book: :crab:

If you want to contact me for some reason I usually have a tab of [twitter](https://twitter.com/the_mallen) open, but I warn you I'm very insufferable there. You can also message me on discord at `Maru#6806`
